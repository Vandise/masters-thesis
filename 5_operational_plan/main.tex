\section{Implementation Framework}

As discussed in Section \ref{guiding.principles}, Cereus will follow the "Living Principles for Design" AIGA framework \cite{brink.aiga.2020} to guide implementation efforts. Section \ref{guiding.principles} emphasizes that many of our operations along the interpersonal and cultural dimensions are limited to the transparency of our customers. Though we encourage our customers to share the information in our audits, we ultimately leave the decision to them.

Many of the criteria of AIGA along the environmental dimension don't often apply to a company offering software-as-a-service as we have no physical products. To minimize any environmental impact required by data storage, web hosting, networking, and data processing, we will rely on cloud services for our operations.

In the case of the economic dimension, Cereus aims to automate privacy compliance auditing for websites. This technological advancement will reduce the amount of time and resources required to conduct a privacy audit. We believe that this will allow our customers to focus and dedicate more resources towards achieving their goals and growing their business. Our overall economic impact is limited to the the actions of our customers and is expected to be minimal.

\section{Production}

Cereus's founders will develop all software in-house using open-source tools, libraries, and frameworks. Strict quality control measures will be taken, including continuous integration, unit testing, integration testing, and code reviews. All code will be under source control and versioned.

One of the three founders will be in charge of all product development and management. The product manager will receive feedback from our customers and allocate work to the developers based. For each software development iteration (sprint), Cereus will deliver a minimum viable product for each feature designated by the product manager. Customer feedback will further shape how our product operates.

\section{Location}

Cereus will not lease or physically owned any real estate. We offer software-as-a-service through a cloud provider. The founders will be able to contribute to the development of our products and services without any special equipment. 

Correspondence pertaining to Cereus will operate through a PO Box.
