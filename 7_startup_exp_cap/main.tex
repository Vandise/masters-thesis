{\let\cleardoublepage\relax \chapter{Expenses and Capitalization}}

Prior to releasing our products and services to the public, we will have to establish ourselves as an S Corporation in the state of Wisconsin and with the Internal Revenue Service. We will also have to implement our proposed products, infrastructure, and business rules.

The development and research time to implement a minimal-viable product of all our services we want to offer our customers could be considered expenses for our initial startup. To reduce the initial capital investment required to begin operations, at the cost of market presence, the founder's have constructed all business processes and products described in Section \ref{products.services.desc}.
