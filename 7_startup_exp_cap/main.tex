\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Expenses and Capitalization}

Before releasing our products and services to the public, we will have to establish ourselves as an S Corporation in the state of Wisconsin and with the Internal Revenue Service. We will also have to implement our proposed products, infrastructure, and business rules.

The development and research time to implement a minimal-viable product of all our services we want to offer our customers could be considered expenses for our initial startup. To reduce the initial capital investment required to begin operations, at the cost of market presence, the founders have constructed all business processes and products described in the \nameref{products.services.desc} section.

\section{Startup Expenses} \label {startup.exp}

\begin{itemize}

\item Marketing

A budget of \$250 per month to serve targeted advertisements on popular search engines and social media platforms (\nameref{section.admin.costs}).

\item Accounting

Up to \$200 per month to general accounting operations will be budgeted (\nameref{section.admin.costs}). 

\item Incorporation

To assist with establishing Cereus as an S Corporation, we will contract an agency to incorporate our business. LegalZoom will charge \$149 plus any state filing fees to file the required documents \cite{legalzoom.2020}. The Wisconsin incorporation filing fee is \$40 \cite{wi.2018}.

\item Contingencies

During our first year of operations, we will reserve an additional 10\% of known expenses, as recommended by the SBA, to account for any potential fluctuations in the budget and/or unknowns \cite{sba.2020}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent
Including the infrastructure costs of \$157.14 (\nameref{infra.costs}) for initial testing and debugging, our startup expenses will be around \$875.75.

\section{Capitalization}

Cereus's three founders will make an initial investment of \$8,500.00 to cover a year's worth of known expenses, start-up costs, and contingencies. This will allow our company to actively monitor up to 100 websites until it's cash-positive -- 17 personal subscriptions (Table \ref{table.cereus.breakeven}).
