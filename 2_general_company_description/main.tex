\section{Industry Overview}

The privacy technology industry is a rapidly growing field in the U.S. In 2020, it is the fastest growing technology sector that includes the fastest growing company in the U.S \cite{hughes.iapp.2020}. As more consumers become impacted by massive data breaches in which sensitive, personally identifying information (PII), is exposed; consumer awareness and the call for data processing regulations are expected to be on the rise.

There are already governmental regulations impacting businesses in the U.S. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) highly regulates patient information and how it is stored. The California Privacy Protection Act (CCPA) regulates the selling of user data collected by a business for consumers in the state of California. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) imposes requirements on website operators on collecting information from children under the age of 13 years old. Then the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives European Union citizens the right to manage their information any business has collected on them and requires explicit consent before information is collected.

With all these regulations, foreign and domestic, companies that collect information from their customers are relying on the assistance of privacy technologies to operate within the bounds of new regulations and meet consumer privacy expectations \cite{meehan.forbes.2019}. This has attracted massive funding, and, in July of 2019, OneTrust raised \$200 million in a Series A investment, TrustArc raised \$70 million Series D, Privitar raised \$40 million series B, and BigID raised \$30 million Series B \cite{wood.fpf.2019}.

In four years since its founding, as of August, 2020, OneTrust is valued at \$2.7 billion \cite{hughes.iapp.2020}.
