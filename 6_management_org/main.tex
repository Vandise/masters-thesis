As an S Corporation, Cereus is required to have a board of directors \cite{UpCounsel.2020}. We are required to pay all employees a reasonable salary, have only one class of stock, have less than 100 share holders, and all share holders must be U.S. citizens or legal residents \cite{wave.2019}. Given that we do not anticipate hiring any employees during the first year of operations, the three founders will be required to manage all operations pertaining to: support, sales, marketing, engineering, and product.

\subsection{Board of Directors}

Initially, all company stock will be held by the three founders. The board of directors will consist of five people -- including the three founders. The other two board members will be elected by the three founders identifying local leaders, preferably with experience in: software development, marketing, privacy law, and/or data science. Should any board member be incapacitated or ask to be dismissed, the remaining board members will elect a replacement.

\subsection{Attorney}

As discussed in Section \ref{legal.environment}, Cereus will consult with an attorney to establish a terms of use and release of liability contract to be used for all of our customers. We don't anticipate the need for a permanent attorney position during our first year of operations. As the company grows, our products expand, and legislation is passed or changed; the need for full-time attorney may be justified.
